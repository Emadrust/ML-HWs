I was carrying a credit balance of {$2800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and this credit was reversed, with a debit on XX/XX/XXXX with the reason given credit refund as requested. Several issues present themselves here. First, I did not request a credit refund. Second in over 22 years with Citi as a credit card customer Citi never did this on my account. When I signed on to chat XXXX responded and informed me that a check was being issued but it was being held because of a dispute with a merchant. The amounts in dispute, there are two of them, total {$120.00} and I will not belabor the lack of logic in the discrepancy of the amount held vs. the dispute nor the fact that this has never been the policy. XXXX continued to state that this was normal policy and I know it is not, at least not on my account for over 22 years. I believe that the funds have been misappropriated and that Citi is unable to provide a reason for either the difference or why, suddenly, the decision to remove a credit and cover it up by telling me it was as requested. I asked to speak with a supervisor but was advised to wait until one was available. I had simply asked for an email from a supervisor stating the policy and assuring me the check would in fact be processed.

To address these challenges, we explore **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods, which allow us to utilize the power of large pretrained models without requiring extensive resources.\n",

Instead of updating all parameters during training, LoRA trains these small matrices while keeping the majority of the original parameters frozen.  This is achieved as follows:\n",

        "1. **Frozen Weights**: The pretrained weights of the model, represented as a weight matrix $ W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k} $, remain **frozen** during fine-tuning.\n",

        "   Instead of directly updating $ W $, LoRA introduces two trainable matrices, $ A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r} $ and $ B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times k} $, where $ r \\ll \\min(d, k) $.  \n",
